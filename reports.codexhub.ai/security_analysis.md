# Security Analysis Report - Snowflake MCP Server

**Repository**: Snowflake MCP Server  
**Analysis Date**: August 22, 2025  
**Analysis Tools**: Bandit, Semgrep, Manual Review

## Executive Summary

The Snowflake MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to perform read-only queries against Snowflake databases. This security analysis identified **2 medium-severity** and **3 low-severity** security issues. The most significant findings relate to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities through string-based query construction and binding to all network interfaces.

Overall, the codebase implements several important security controls:
- Input validation and parsing using sqlglot to prevent non-read-only operations
- Parameterized environment variable configuration
- Secure handling of private keys
- Connection pooling with automatic refresh
- Pydantic models for data validation

However, the identified issues should be addressed to further enhance the security posture of the application.

## Key Findings

### Medium Severity Issues

1. **SQL Injection Risk (CWE-89)** - Medium Severity
   - **Location**: `snowflake_mcp_server/main.py:358:25`
   - **Description**: String formatting is used to construct SQL queries, which can lead to SQL injection if untrusted input is used.
   - **Impact**: Could potentially allow manipulation of SQL queries if user inputs are not properly validated.
   - **Remediation**: Use parameterized queries instead of string formatting.

   ```python
   # Current vulnerable code:
   cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM {full_view_name} LIMIT {limit}")
   
   # Recommended fix:
   cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM %s LIMIT %s", (full_view_name, limit))
   ```

2. **Binding to All Interfaces (CWE-605)** - Medium Severity
   - **Location**: `snowflake_mcp_server/main.py:533:46`
   - **Description**: The server binds to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0), which may expose it to unauthorized access.
   - **Impact**: Potential exposure of the server to unintended networks.
   - **Remediation**: Consider binding only to localhost (127.0.0.1) when not explicitly needed for remote access.

   ```python
   # Current code:
   mcp.run(transport="streamable-http", host="0.0.0.0", port=port, path="/snowflake")
   
   # Recommended fix:
   host = os.getenv("MCP_SERVER_HOST", "127.0.0.1")  # Default to localhost, allow override
   mcp.run(transport="streamable-http", host=host, port=port, path="/snowflake")
   ```

### Low Severity Issues

1. **Assert Usage in Production Code (CWE-703)** - Low Severity
   - **Location**: `snowflake_mcp_server/utils/snowflake_conn.py:173:12`
   - **Description**: Use of assert statements in production code, which can be compiled out with optimized bytecode.
   - **Impact**: When running with optimizations enabled (python -O), the assert statement will be removed, potentially hiding issues.
   - **Remediation**: Replace assert with proper error handling.

   ```python
   # Current code:
   assert self._connection is not None, "Connection is None after connect attempt"
   
   # Recommended fix:
   if self._connection is None:
       raise ValueError("Connection is None after connect attempt")
   ```

2. **Broad Exception Handling (CWE-703)** - Low Severity
   - **Location**: Multiple locations in `snowflake_mcp_server/utils/snowflake_conn.py`
   - **Description**: Broad exception handling with pass statements used to ignore errors during connection close.
   - **Impact**: May hide important errors or lead to unexpected behavior.
   - **Remediation**: Consider logging these exceptions or handling specific exception types.

   ```python
   # Current code:
   try:
       self._connection.close()
   except Exception:
       pass  # Ignore errors during close
       
   # Recommended fix:
   try:
       self._connection.close()
   except Exception as e:
       logging.debug(f"Non-critical error during connection close: {e}")
   ```

## Detailed Analysis

### Authentication Security

The application supports two authentication methods to Snowflake:
1. **Private Key Authentication**: Uses service account with private key
2. **External Browser Authentication**: Interactive login through browser

Private key handling appears to be implemented securely:
- Private keys can be provided via files or embedded in environment variables
- Uses proper cryptographic libraries (cryptography.hazmat) for key loading
- No hardcoded passwords were found in the codebase

### SQL Injection Protection

The codebase implements several controls to prevent SQL injection, though improvements are needed:

**Positive Controls:**
- SQL query validation using sqlglot to parse and validate query types
- Allows only read-only operations (SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, EXPLAIN, WITH)
- Automatic limit clause to prevent large result sets

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Replace string formatting (f-strings) in SQL queries with proper parameterized queries
- Multiple instances of unparameterized SQL queries were found, particularly in functions like:
  - `list_views`
  - `describe_view`
  - `query_view`

### Network Security

The server binds to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) by default, which could expose it to unauthorized access if not properly secured through other means (e.g., firewall rules). Consider making this configurable and defaulting to localhost for development environments.

### Environment Variable Handling

Environment variables are used extensively for configuration, which is a good practice. The implementation includes:
- Proper validation of required parameters
- Fallback to sensible defaults
- Pydantic models for configuration validation

No sensitive credentials appear to be hardcoded, as they are expected to be provided through environment variables or configuration files.

### Query Result Processing

Query results are properly sanitized before being returned:
- Long values are truncated to prevent excessive data exposure
- Special characters in markdown tables are escaped
- NULL values are handled appropriately

### Dependency Analysis

No known vulnerabilities in direct dependencies were identified during this scan. Key security-related dependencies include:
- snowflake-connector-python: Used for Snowflake connections
- cryptography: Used for private key handling
- pydantic: Used for data validation
- sqlglot: Used for SQL query parsing and validation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Replace String-based SQL Construction**: Replace all instances of f-string SQL queries with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

2. **Add Host Configuration**: Make the binding address configurable with a default of localhost.

3. **Improve Exception Handling**: Replace broad exception handling and pass statements with proper logging and specific exception types.

4. **Replace Assert Statements**: Use explicit validation instead of assert statements in production code.

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Add Request Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the service.

2. **Enhanced Logging**: Add structured logging for security events:
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - Rejected non-read-only SQL queries
   - Connection failures

3. **Query Whitelisting**: Consider implementing a whitelist of allowed SQL queries or templates for higher security environments.

4. **Add Input Validation**: Implement more strict input validation for all parameters before constructing SQL queries.

### Long-term Considerations

1. **Authentication Enhancements**: Consider adding token-based authentication for the MCP server itself.

2. **Security Headers**: If serving over HTTPS, implement proper security headers.

3. **Regular Dependency Updates**: Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

4. **Security Testing**: Incorporate security testing into the development pipeline.

## Conclusion

The Snowflake MCP Server implements several good security practices, particularly around authentication and input validation. The most significant security concerns relate to SQL injection risks from string-formatted queries and default binding to all interfaces. By addressing these issues and implementing the recommended improvements, the security posture of the application can be significantly enhanced.
